Hi I'm Cappy Ishihara and I maintain a couple of custom Fedora packages, I also contribute to some apps and stuff on a whim.

I maintain the Fedora Jam+ Repository over at COPR, a software compilation offering additional apps that allow the use of non-free DSP plugins and more. I also am working on a Friday Night Funkin' Engine that allows for full binary reproducibility for mods, and the loading of assets by packages known as FWADs instead of directly recompiling the binary and assets.
