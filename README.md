# About me!

Hi! My name is Cappy Ishihara. It's not really my real name but I like to be called Cappy, Because I think it sounds cute.

I am from Thailand, and I'm currently a NEET(?).

I am non-binary and I usually code in my free time. I'm a big IT nerd and I love to learn new things.

I code in Python, C, and Rust; and my favorite programming language is Rust! It takes a while to build but the end product should be robust!

I believe that all knowledge should and must be free, and all code should be able to be taken apart and studied

I'm also the founder and the maintainer of Ultramarine Linux. My specialty is in SRE & Software Engineering
