# About me!

Hi! My name is Cappy Ishihara. It's not really my real name but I like to be called Cappy, Because I think it sounds cute.

I am from Thailand, and I'm currently a NEET(?).

I am non-binary and I usually code in my free time. I'm a big IT nerd and I love to learn new things.

I code in Python, C, and Rust; and my favorite programming language is Rust! It takes a while to build but the end product is blazing fast!

I'm also the founder and the maintainer of Ultramarine Linux. My specialty is in DevOps engineering.
