# About me!

Hi! My name is Cappy Ishihara. It's not really my real name but I like to be called Cappy, Because I think it sounds cute.

I am from Thailand, and I'm currently a student at the Srinakharinwirot University Demonstration School!

I am non-binary and I usually code in my free time. I'm a big IT nerd and I love to learn new things.

I code in Python, C, and Rust; and my favorite programming language is Rust! It takes a while to build but the end product is blazing fast!

I'm also the founder and the maintainer of Ultramarine Linux. My specialty is in DevOps engineering.

## My background

I started using computers when I was 4 years old. The earliest memories of computers were me playing GTA: Vice City and C&C: Red Alert 2 on the neighbour's computer.

I got into coding when I wanted to write a Discord bot when I was in middle school. I started learning Python and JavaScript (which I eventually forgot). I later got into coding again when I started using Linux as a daily driver around a year ago. I was maintaining Fedora packages and I even had my own Linux Distribution (Ultramarine Linux) which is still active to this day!

## My beliefs

I believe in a world where we all do our part to do something for the greater good. I believe in the old-school hacker mentality: A meritocracy where we are not judged by our background, age, or social status, but the merits of our own actions.

It doesn't matter where you come from or what you look like, if you are doing something cool, you're cool to me!

Personally, I don't believe in the fact that real-world politics should be in programming. People should be able to use open-source software to do whatever the hell they want. What do you mean you're [trying to stop capitalists and evil people from using your software](https://anticapitalist.software/)? [How](https://github.com/jgrey4296/acab/blob/main/LICENSE) [are](https://firstdonoharm.dev/) [you](https://git.pixie.town/thufie/npl-builder) going to enforce that?

Anyway, rambling aside, I believe that anyone can do whatever the fuck they want with free software.

## My hobbies

I play alot of video games, and I do make music sometimes. I stream on Twitch once in a while and you can catch me live at [twitch.tv/CupOChino](https://twitch.tv/CupOChino).
